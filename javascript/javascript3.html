a)  Loose Equality (==)

its stands for equality

• Loose equality compares two values after converting both values to a common type.

>Returns true, 
> if Values after converting to a common type are equal Type need not be equal 
> Otherwise returns false


b)  Strict Equality

Compares two values for equality.

Neither value is implicitly converted to value before being compared.

some other

If the values have different types, the values are considered unequal.

• value and type should be equal Preferred option for checking equality



c)Truthy and Falsy

• All values are truthy unless they are defined as falsy.

• The falsy values are False - the keyword false

0- the number zero """- empty string

null

Undefined

NaN - not a number

Truthy and Falsy A truthy value is a value that is considered true

when encountered in a boolean context. A falsy value is a value that is considered false when encountered in a boolean context.


e)Explain Not Operator with an example
In Boolean algebra, the NOT operator is a Boolean operator that returns TRUE or 1 when the operand is FALSE or 0, and returns FALSE or 0 when the operand is TRUE or 1.The NOT operator is considered one of the basic operators along with AND and OR in Boolean algebra.

f)Explain And Operator with an example.
In computer programming and at the command line, an operator is an object that is capable of manipulating a value or operator. For example, in "1 + 2", the "1" and "2" are the operands and the plus symbol is the operator.

G) Explain Or Operator with an example
In computer programming and at the command line, an operator is an object that is capable of manipulating a value or operator. For example, in "1 + 2", the "1" and "2" are the operands and the plus symbol is the operator

h) What is a ternary operator. Why do we use it.
The ternary operator is an operator that exists in some programming languages, which takes three operands rather than the typical one or two that most operators use. It provides a way to shorten a simple if else block. For example, consider the below JavaScript code.
